# Matplotlib-Challenge

The purpose of this research study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatments. Using MatPlotLib and Pandas Python libraries in a Jupyter notebook, following analysis was done:
A summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
A bar plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the number of data points for each treatment regimen.
A pie plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.
